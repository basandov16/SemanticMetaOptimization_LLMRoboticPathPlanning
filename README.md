# Semantic Meta Optimization - LLM Robotic Path Planning
## Overview
This project combines semantic meta-optimization with large language models (LLMs) to enhance robotic path planning. It leverages advanced language models to improve trajectory optimization and navigation strategies for autonomous systems.

## Features
- LLM-based semantic understanding for path planning
- Meta-optimization framework for continuous improvement
- Integration with robotic systems
- Adaptive navigation strategies
